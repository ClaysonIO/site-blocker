      <p>
        The Site Blocker extension does not collect any personal information from users. 
        All data related to your blocked sites is stored locally on your device and is not 
        transmitted to any external servers.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Local Storage Only</h2>
      <p>
        Your list of blocked websites and settings are stored exclusively in your browser's 
        local storage. This information never leaves your device and is not accessible to 
        anyone but you.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">No Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        Site Blocker does not track your browsing history, behavior, or any other activity. 
        The extension only checks if the current website matches any domain in your block list.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        The extension requires certain permissions to function properly, such as access to 
        tabs and web navigation. These permissions are used solely for the purpose of 
        blocking specified websites and are not used to collect or transmit any data.
      </p>
